HERE I WANT TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE EXECUTION ORDER OF SQL:

1. FROM - choose and join tables to get tha base DATABASE
2. WHERE - Filters the data depending on the CONDITION
3. GROUP BY - aggregates and groups the base DATABASE
4. HAVING - filters the aggregated DATABASE
5. SELECT - returns the final DATA
6. ORDER BY - sorts the final DATA
7. LIMIT - limits the returned data to a row count 

FWGHSOL - EXECUTION ORDER OF SQL;
